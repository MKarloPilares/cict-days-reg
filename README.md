This registration system was developed for use during the event CICT Days of the UB College of Information and Communications Technology. It was designed to facilitate student registration for the IT Congress 2025 Seminar.

Students can register by having the barcode on their school IDs scanned. Once scanned, their data is retrieved from the university's database and automatically inputted into the system.

Registered students become eligible to participate in the system's lottery feature. Additionally, the application includes a dashboard for administrators to manage registrants and lottery winners.

Features:

    1. Barcode reader registration.
    2. Access to student database (removed for this archive)
    3. Lottery for registered students.
    4. Live reactions page.
    5. Admin dashboard for management of registrations and lottery winners.
